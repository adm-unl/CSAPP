archlab-handout directory contains my solutions to parts A, B and, C of the lab.

For part A solution, see the following files in sim/y86-code directory:
    sum.ys - Y86-64 implementation of the sum_list C function. 
    rsum.ys - Y86-64 implementation of the rsum_list C function.
    copy.ys - Y86-64 implementation of the copy_block C function.

For part B solution, see the following files in the sim/seq directory:
    seq-full.hcl - implements IADDQ instruction into SEQ hardware description.

For part C solution, see the following files in the sim/pipe directory:
    pipe-full.hcl - implements IADDQ instruction into the PIPE hardware description.
    ncopy.ys - contains optimised version of the original ncopy.ys function. 
    
    Here is a list of the optimisations made to the ncopy function:
        - reduced total number of instructions inside inner loop by replacing 
          (irmovq -> opq) instructions sequences with a single iaddq instruction. 
        - implemented 2x1 loop unrolling to reduce number of loop iterations. 
        - avoided load and use hazard by rearranging the order of read and write
          instructions inside inner loop.
        - removed redundant instructions for condition checking (e.g., removed
          andq %rdx, %rdx instruction by reordering decrementing length to just
          before conditional jump instruction). 
        - attempted to implement data transfer to reduce number of jumps in inner
          loop but control transfer seemed to perform better. 
   
    Achieved an average CPE of 8.75, reduced by nearly a factor of 2 from the 
    initial average of 15.18.
